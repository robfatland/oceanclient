    "```\n",
    "import oceanclient as oc\n",
    "dfT, dfS = oc.Chart('2022-01-05', 6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "to run properly there are three necessary preparation steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to clone a GitHub\n",
    "repository, that is, make a local copy on your workstation. \n",
    "The Linux `bash` shell command is\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/robfatland/oceanclient\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a folder called `oceanclient` containing a Python\n",
    "module file `oceanclient.py` and this Jupyter notebook `sensors.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second preparatory step is to install Python including\n",
    "Jupyter Lab, a browser based interpreter that runs Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "This interpreter is launched via\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The third preparatory step is to verify that five Python libraries are installed,\n",
    "to wit: `requests`, `time`, `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this preparation done the two lines of code at the top of `sensors.ipynb` \n",
    "will run. The first line of code runs the module file `oceanclient.py` to make\n",
    "the `Chart()` function available. The second line of code then runs `Chart()` by\n",
    "passing two arguments: A date and an integer from 1 to 9 inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to presenting the chart, this function call also returns two `pandas` \n",
    "dataframes that are assigned to `dfT` and `dfS`, respectively temperature and\n",
    "salinity. The data represent a profile (vertical axis) through 200 meters of the\n",
    "upper ocean; hence as depth increases from the surface to 200 meters depth \n",
    "the ocean temperature decreases and the salinity increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a small example only the days January 1 through 5 of 2022 are available.\n",
    "Profiling runs happen nine times per day, hence the second parameter takes a value \n",
    "of 1 through 9. In sum about 45 profiles are available. Next we turn to the backing\n",
    "effort required to set up this data API. "

    "parenthetical details from this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design the data access of interest: Dataset and format\n",
    "    - Temperature and Salinity are selected from 20 sensor types as simple examples\n",
    "    - Pandas dataframes are very simple to work with (contrast with XArray Datasets)\n",
    "- Configure / clean the data\n",
    "    - We are only interested in profiler *ascent* data\n",
    "        - ...while *descent* and *at-rest* sensor data are not of primary importance\n",
    "        - ...the nine ascent profiles acquired per day are indexed 1, 2, ..., 9\n",
    "- Load the data into a cloud database\n",
    "    - We used VSCode as the development environment\n",
    "        - ...in conjunction with a low power / low cost Azure Virtual Machine\n",
    "        - ...and a NoSQL database (see *Azure Cosmos DB*)\n",
    "- Test simple queries to verify correct operation\n",
    "    - Here the data accessed through the cloud database should match \"same data in hand\" \n",
    "- Create a web-facing point of contact\n",
    "    - This is a URL that runs a serverless function\n",
    "    - See 'Azure Function App'\n",
    "    - We can verify this API works as expected prior to connecting it to the data source\n",
    "- Connect local Python code to the API by means of the `requests` library\n",
    "    - Once this is established it will be helpful in creating the Client as described above\n",
    "- Provide secure credentials to the serverless function to access the database\n",
    "    - This insulates the database from direct contact from the internet\n",
    "- Connect the serverless function to the database\n",
    "    - The test is now a there-and-back-again transaction:\n",
    "        - Local Python code > API call > request > Serverless Function > Database query\n",
    "        - Database response > Serverless function > reply > local Python\n",
    "    - This transaction works smoothly for a few thousand data points\n",
    "        - The transaction time is a few seconds\n",
